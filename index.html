    <h2>Welcome to Our Beach Cleaning Initiative</h2>
    <p>We are a group of enthusiastic high school students from Taiwan, committed to protecting our coastlines and marine life. Our initiative focuses on organizing beach clean-ups, educating the community, and advocating for environmental conservation.</p>

  <h2>Why Beach Cleaning Matters</h2>
  <p>Beach cleaning plays a vital role in environmental protection and public health. One of the most important issues beach cleaning addresses is protecting marine life. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) reports that more than 800 species globally are adversely affected by marine debris, a large proportion of which is plastic. These fragments often appear on beaches and in seawater, posing a serious threat to aquatic animals. Many marine organisms mistakenly ingest plastic waste or become entangled in it, resulting in injury or death. By clearing litter from beach areas, we can significantly reduce these hazards and contribute to the protection of marine biodiversity.</p>
  <p>In addition to the impact on marine life, the health of beach ecosystems is also critical. Beaches are more than just places to relax; they are complex ecosystems that support a variety of organisms. Litter and pollution on beaches disrupt these ecosystems, harming not only life in the sand and water, but also the wider marine environment. Therefore, keeping beaches clean is vital to the overall health of Earth's marine ecosystems. </p>
  <p>The impacts of beach pollution also extend to human health and safety. Beaches are littered with potentially hazardous objects such as broken glass, rusty metal and even medical waste, posing a real danger to beachgoers. Additionally, polluted beaches can lead to contaminated waters, posing risks to swimmers and local communities. From a public health perspective, clean beaches are non-negotiable. </p>
  <p>Finally, there is an economic dimension to consider. Beaches are often the main attraction for local tourism. Polluted and poorly maintained beaches can deter tourists and negatively impact the local economy. In contrast, clean and well-maintained beaches attract more visitors and boost the economic well-being of coastal communities. </p>
  <p>At its core, beach cleaning is not just about looking good; This is a necessary activity with far-reaching impacts on environmental protection, public health and local economies. It is closely linked to many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including Goal 14 (life below water) and Goal 15 (life on land) that emphasize the conservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources, including goals to protect biodiversity and ecosystems . </p>
