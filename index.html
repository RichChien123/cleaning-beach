    <h2>Why Beach Cleaning Matters</h2>
    <p>Beach cleaning plays a vital role in environmental protection and public health. One of the most important issues beach cleaning addresses is protecting marine life. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) reports that more than 800 species globally are adversely affected by marine debris, a large proportion of which is plastic. These fragments often appear on beaches and in seawater, posing a serious threat to aquatic animals. Many marine organisms mistakenly ingest plastic waste or become entangled in it, resulting in injury or death. By clearing litter from beach areas, we can significantly reduce these hazards and contribute to the protection of marine biodiversity.</p>
    <p>In addition to the impact on marine life, the health of beach ecosystems is also critical. Beaches are more than just places to relax; they are complex ecosystems that support a variety of organisms. Litter and pollution on beaches disrupt these ecosystems, harming not only life in the sand and water, but also the wider marine environment. Therefore, keeping beaches clean is vital to the overall health of Earth's marine ecosystems. </p>
