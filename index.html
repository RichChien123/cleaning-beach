    <h2>About Beach Cleaning</h2>
    <p>
      Beach pollution refers to the pollution and degradation of coastal and shoreline areas,
      usually caused by various human activities and natural factors.
      This pollution can adversely affect the environment, marine life and public health.
      Common sources of beach pollution include:
    </p>
    1.Plastic waste: Plastic debris such as bottles,
    bags and microplastics often wash up on beaches,
    posing a significant threat to marine animals that may ingest or become entangled in them.
    </p>
    2.Oil spills: Oil spills from shipping accidents or offshore
    drilling can have devastating effects on beach ecosystems, covering shorelines and harming wildlife.
    </p>
    3.Sewage and wastewater: Improperly treated sewage and wastewater discharges can introduce harmful pathogens and
    chemicals into coastal waters, making them unsuitable for swimming and damaging aquatic ecosystems.
    </p>
    4.Agricultural runoff: Excessive fertilizers, pesticides and sediments in agricultural areas can pollute coastal
    waters, causing problems such as harmful algal blooms and oxygen depletion.
    </p>
    5.Last but not least, Trash and trash: Litter, including cigarette butts, food wrappers and discarded beach
    equipment, can accumulate on beaches, ruining their natural beauty and affecting wildlife.


    <p>
      The consequences of beach pollution are far-reaching and include damage to fragile ecosystems, harm to marine
      animals through ingestion and entanglement, reduced recreational opportunities, and economic losses for coastal
      communities that rely on tourism. Efforts to combat beach pollution involve public awareness campaigns,
      beach cleanups, stricter regulations on waste disposal and industrial practices, and the promotion of sustainable
      living to reduce the use of plastic and harmful chemicals.

    <h2>Beach Pollution</h2>
    <p>
      Beach pollution poses a severe threat to our oceans and marine life. The most common types of
      beach pollution include plastic waste, oil spills, and chemical runoff from nearby urban areas.
      These pollutants can harm wildlife and damage delicate ecosystems.
    </p>
    <p>
      By participating in beach cleaning initiatives, we can reduce pollution levels and protect the
      health of our beaches and marine habitats.
